No scripts/diff for this one. Files are provided as a guide.

** Steps **
-> Grab a copy of gas-preprocessor from /ffmpeg/ 
-> Run configure
-> Edit config.mak (see file), make sure it has the right tools (gcc-ar for example is wrong)
-> MAKE SURE $AS IS = "gas-preprocessor.pl -as-type clang -- <YOUR-TRIPLE>-clang". 
	You /will/ get undefined symbols and go insane if this is not done!
-> Edit the Makefile, $(AS) gets it wrong by doing 'clang -o common/foo.S bar'
	The right syntax is 'clang -o common/foo.S -c bar' (see file)
